A cookie is a piece of data that a website sends to your browser and which is then stored on your computer or other internet enabled device. Cookies are generally one of two types, a session cookie or a persistent cookie. A session cookie is a temporary cookie that is placed on the device and remains until you leave one of our websites. A persistent cookie will remain on your device for a period of time or duration specified in the cookie despite you leaving our websites.

                Cookies generally allow our websites you are browsing to interact more efficiently with your device.

                Purposes of collection of personal information
                We collect your personal information so we can:
                • identify you and provide you with our products and services including notifying you about new products, services and promotions from time to time.
                • understand your requirements and provide you with a product or service;
                • set up, administer and manage our products and services,
                • get a better understanding of you, your needs, your behaviours and how you interact with us, so we can engage in product and service research, development and business strategy including managing the delivery of our services and products via the ways we communicate with you.

                Sometimes we are required to collect your personal information to satisfy specific legal obligations.

                Use and disclosure
                We use and disclose your personal information for the purposes we collected it. Please refer to “Purposes of collection of personal information” section to understand what these purposes may be.
                If your personal information is subject to the Australian privacy regime, we will use and disclose your personal information for a secondary purpose related to a purpose for which we collected it, where you would reasonably expect us to use or disclose your personal information for that secondary purpose. In the case of sensitive information, any secondary use or disclosure will be directly related to the purpose of collection.

                For example, we will disclose your personal information to third party service providers so that they can provide the contracted services to Grande Travel such as information technology support or programming, hosting services, telephony services, mailing or sending of documentation to customers digitally or otherwise.

                As a travel agent, Grande Travel offers products and services on behalf of a number of other providers including but not limited to cruise lines and insurance companies. Grande Travel maybe required to disclose your Personal Information to these providers to enable them to provide you with their services and to assist in making your experience a satisfying one. As these providers require this Personal Information when making your booking, if it is not provided we will not be able to finalise your booking.

                There will be other instances when we may use and disclose your personal information in accordance with the Australian and New Zealand privacy regimes including where:
                • you have expressly or impliedly consented to the use or disclosure;

                Collection use and disclosure of personal information for marketing

We use a wide variety of marketing strategies including mail, sms, telephone and other internet based marketing including targeted online advertising and online behavioural marketing. Third party marketing service providers may combine the personal information we disclose to them with information they already hold about you, in order to serve you with more relevant advertising about our products and services.

                We want you to be able to exercise your marketing preferences. Details of how to exercise your preferences can be made to our privacy officer whose contact details are below.
